Development log
---------------

TODO:

    [H] create command blocks- just like mode blocks but for commands.
    [H] for list modes, create mode blocks to be fired for viewing lists
    [H] RPL_ISUPPORT
    [H] list mode listing
    [H] no speaking if banned in channel
    [M] burst topic
    [L] idle time in WHOIS
    [L] MOTD server parameter
    [L] add modes secret and private and then make NAMES accurate to them
    [L] TARGMAX and target limits

TODO for stability and performance:

    maximum connections in x seconds
    connection throttle

STARTED BUT NOT FINISHED:

    I added the ability to connect servers remotely but never made the CONNECT user command
    capable of making it useful.

    most channel modes are entirely screwed up. Permissions make little sense. 

OPER FLAGS:

    see_invisible:  can see invisible users in NAMES
    connect:        use the CONNECT command locally
    gconnect:       use the CONNECT command globally
    modload:        use the MODLOAD command
    modunload:      use the MODUNLOAD command
    rehash:         use REHASH command locally
    kill:           use KILL command locally
    gkill:          use KILL command globally

PLANS:

    GENERAL:

        none yet

    LINKING:

        rather than remote includes, send certain configuration values over the linking protocol
        modes to be known by their names, types, or levels rather than letters
        make the linking protocol more compact by combining commands

    CHANNELS:

        internally support many of the channel modes provided by charybdis

API PLANS:

    GENERAL:

        create a module API similar to juno v2's, except with the ability to "override" commands, modes, etc

        module: fake ban
        module: abuse
        module: named mode setting

    LINKING:

        none yet

    CHANNELS:

        support many of the channel modes provided by unrealircd and inspircd modules
        module: channel mode to show invite notices

CHANGES:

3. April 30, 2011

    0. April 30, 2011

        0. April 30, 2011

            0. Added directory finder.

            1. Finished configuration parser and fetcher functions.

            2. Fixed configuration parser.

            3. Added load_requirements() and fatal() util.
               user.pm is now solely for users; connection.pm will handle connections.

            4. Whoops, forgot to put fatal() in @EXPORT_OK.
               fatal() logs the method that called it now.
               Added create_sockets() to create listening sockets and fatal() if not listening.
               Added main loop stuff.
               Added handler to connection.pm (kinda.)
               Added send functions.

            May 1, 2011

            5. Added basic pre-registration commands and temporary incoming data handler (without any form of flood protection.)

            6. Set connection->{ready} when NICK and USER have both been verified.
               Made the configuration parser ignore blank lines.
               Finished outgoing buffer.

            7. Added user::new() and some more user.pm stuff.

            8. Added connection::lookup() to a find a connection by its user or server object.
               Finished connection.pm's data forwarding to user.pm or server.pm.

            9. Finished SERVER and PASS.

        1. May 1, 2011

            0. Fixed realname bug.
               Change configuration setup.

            1. Fixed crash if disconnect before register.
               Allow any drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET such as IO::Socket::IP or IO::Socket::INET6.
               Finished flood protection and incoming buffer.

            2. Added md5 support.
               Changed configuration some more.
               Added autoconnect and stuff.

            3. Added more linking stuff.

            May 2, 2011

            4. If the credentials have been sent, don't send them again.

            5. Created server::linkage for local protocol functions.

        2. June 12, 2011

            0. Add trim() util.
               Keep track of server descriptions in server.pm.
               Configuration parser now takes literal values and has improved syntax.
               user::mine module is for handling of local user data.

            1. Finished ping system!
               Failure to respond to the first PING now leads to a registration timeout on unregistered connections.
               Added lconf() util for fetching name configuration values.
               
            2. Only send PING if there isn't a pending ping.

            3. Constants on and off define true and false values in the configuration.

            4. server::mine contains the linking protocol handler.

            June 13, 2011

            5. a few fixes.

            6. user::numeric contains numerics.
               Keep track of the server users are connecting from.

            7. added more functions to server::mine include send() to send data to a connected server.
               added user::handlers and server::handlers for local handlers.
               keep track of servers' parents.
               other fixes.

        3. June 13, 2011

            0. Fixed bug where IRCd exits when attempting to write on a closed connection.

            1. $user->mine->method() and $server->mine->method() now calls methods in user::mine and server::mine from a user or server object.

            2. Reverted the stupid ->mine stuff.
               Added several shortcuts to *::mine package functions.
                 - you can, of course, call them on an object such as $server->server::mine::send()
               Added register_handler() to server::mine - registers a CODE reference to a command handler.
               Server now handles and sends the UID command.
               Added server::lookup_by_id() to find a server by its SID.

            June 14, 2011

            3. Store server parents by object, not SID.
               Added user::is_local() for determining if the user is on this server.
               server::outgoing contains outgoing commands.
               Added quit() and uid() to server::outgoing.
               Delete all users from a server when that server splits.
               Connects, quits, and bursts should be completely accurate now - the servers should always be synced with users.
               Properly remove child servers, their children, their children's children, and so on when a server splits.

            4. Fixed a bug that sometimes leads to a crash where the local server's parent was unknown (itself).

            5. Fixed several bugs in UID.
               Added SID to share servers from server-to-server.
               BURST no longer sends information on users and servers that the target server is already familiar with.

            June 15, 2011

            6. UID handler now determines who wins a nick collision battle.

            7. Added nick check to registration.
               Fixed a bug that occurred when an unregistered connection disconnected.

            8. Added loop functions to extend the main loop.

        4. June 13, 2011 <- obviously time is going backwards (June 15, 2011)

            0. Added hostname resolving! (don't expect it to be perfect [yet])

            June 16, 2011

            1. Fixed a small bug in the hostname resolver.
               Added "forward" option to server handlers.
               When enabled, this server forwards the line to the child servers.
               Fixed a crash bug on nick collision.

            2. Fixed more bugs in the resolver.

            3. Hopefully these fixes will prevent thousands of nick collisions.

            4. Just kidding; this should fix it.

            5. nope, maybe this will.

            6. I almost promise that it works now.
               Fixed a small bug in quit().

            7. Fixed some bugs. Hopefully it actually does work now.

            8. Never mind, this will fix it.

        5. June 16, 2011

            0. Rewrote the hostname resolving. I think it might actually work now. (but don't believe me; I've already thought that the last 10 commits)

            1. I REALLY think it will work now.

            June 17, 2011

            2. Cleaned up a bit.
               Added hostname notices.
               Added user handler and a few other things to  user::mine.
               Fixed a bug where PINGing was done more often than it should be.

            3. Finished user numeric stuff.
               Added fake USER command.

            June 20, 2011

            4. Added some numerics to user connect.
               Added LUSERS command.
               Added MOTD command.

            June 22, 2011

            5. Added more numerics.

            6. Added NICK user command.
               Relay nick changes to child servers.
               Handle NICK command from servers.
               Added fake PING command.

            7. Added INFO command.
               Added support for SHA224 and SHA384.

            July 7, 2011

            8. Fixed a few small bugs.
               Added the ability to fork and become a daemon.
               Added NOFORK option.

            July 8, 2011

            9. Fixed broken NOFORK option.
               Added RPL_ISUPPORT, but much of it is unfinished since channels don't exist yet.

        6. July 8, 2011

            0. beginning to work on channel.pm.

            1. Added channel join method that keeps the channel time accurate.

            2. Added lookup_by_name() channel function.
               Added some other channely stuff.

            3. RPL_LUSERCHANNELS should only be sent if non-zero.

            4. Made some changes to the user mode system.
               Do not change nicks if the nick is taken.

            5. I probably fell asleep while writing the mode validator thingy, but now it is fixed.

            6. Added is_mode() and unset_modes() user functions.
               Fixed a bug that causes crash on user connect because you can't push to a nonexistence array reference.

        7. July 17, 2011

            0. Moved resolve stuff to separate "res" module.

            1. split RPL_ISUPPORT into several lines when necessary.

            2. random cleanup of outgoing.pm

            3. added some stuff to make sure we only sent BURST once.

            4. changed a few more things in burst.

            5. added user mode module.
               from here on, modes will be named rather than lettered.
               fixed a small warning in RPL_ISUPPORT.

            July 18, 2011

            6. added outgoing ADDUMODE command.

            7. send ADDUMODES in burst.

            8. send my ADDUMODES also.
               register internal modes to the local server.

            9. handle ADDUMODEs.

        8. July 18, 2011

            0. handle UMODE server command.
               added user::handle_mode_string() which translates a string of mode letters to their mode names and sets or unsets them.

            1. added user->mode_string() to create mode strings to the user's local server.
               actually send modes in UID command now.

            2. handle mode strings in UID and apply the modes.

            3. made it possible to add multiple user handlers of the same command (which will be useful later in the module API.)

            4. did the same for server handlers.

            5. added default mode settings.

            6. added MODE user command.
               handle_mode_string() now returns the final mode string, which will be used later.

            7. cleaned up some stuff.

            July 19, 2011

            8. send MODE string back to a user when he sets user modes.
               fixed time bug in resolving.

        9. July 19, 2011

            0. Fixed a small bug in the user mode handler.

            1. added user mode tests. if any of the tests fail, the mode will not be accepted.

            2. send UMODE to other servers.

            3. added PRIVMSG handler! :D
                 local user-to-user PRIVMSGs should work now.

            4. added PRIVMSG server handler.
                 global user-to-user PRIVMSGs should work now.

            5. added a really fail MAP that will be made prettier later.

            6. fixed a few things and added more numerics to LUSERS.

            7. fixed something in LUSERS.
               added nickname in use numeric.

            8. fixed another LUSERS bug.

            9. added NOTICE command.
               send NOTICE from server to server.
               fix a couple small things.

    1. July 20, 2011

        0. July 20, 2011

            0. added join user handler. (yay, soon we will have working channels!)

            1. fixed a bug in the PRIVMSG/NOTICE handler.

            2. omg we have join.

            3. joining a channel now sends NAMES and creation time.

            4. local PRIVMSG to channel now works.
               quit messages are sent to users in common channels now.

            5. send and handle joins among servers.

            6. just kidding. it will work now.

            7. still kidding... maybe this will work.

            8. okay, channel PRIVMSGs now work globally.

            9. send channel joins in burst.

        1. July 20, 2011

            0. Maybe this will fix fail problem?

            1. users should definitely be removed from channels properly now.

            2. I should stop saying 'definitely' when i'm not sure.
                 now they should DEFINITELY be working right.

            3. i'm too unorganized to know or care what changed in this commit.
                 why do i even keep track?
                 odds are that i'm going to do five or six more to fix this commit because it's probably broken
                 just like all the others.

            4. maybe this will fix the flood problem.

            5. or this. hash != hashref.

            6. I THINK CHANNELS ACTUALLY STAY IN SYNC NOW AND I AM USING CAPITALS BECAUSE THIS COMMIT IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT.

            7. show SID in MAP.

            8. added NAMES command.

            9. send NICK messages globally. nicknames should be in sync at all times now.

        2. July 21, 2011 (omg time please no..)

            0. removed LUSERS temporarily because it sucks.
               added OPER command, oper blocks, and oper classes!
                 see the example configuration.
               user->handle_mode_string now takes an optional 'force' argument that, when true, skips the mode tests.
               this new argument is now used in the linking protocol, that way servers can force users to oper up.

            1. added user functions to add/remove/check oper flags.

            2. keep oper flags in sync between servers that way we can user->has_flag for non-local users.

            3. only send the MODE message if the returned string isn't empty.
               send ircop mode to other servers on /oper.

            4. fixed a crash.. dunno why i put 'opers' instead of 'flags'

            5. fixed a bug where you could not unset your oper mode.

            6. rewrote the way mode blocks are done.

            7. RPL_MYINFO now shows the actual user modes registered to the ircd.

            8. connect blocks now allow wildcards in the IP address.

            9. added host option to oper blocks. see example configuration.

        3. July 22, 2011

            0. Added WHOIS command.

            July 23, 2011

            1. Added ISON command.

            2. Added handler description and COMMANDS command as in the earlier version of juno.

            3. Added AWAY user command.

            4. Send and handle AWAY messages from server to server.

            5. Added away line to WHOIS command.
               notify users when they send PRIVMSGs to away users.

            6. Added QUIT command (both as a normal command a pre-registration command.)

            7. might as well use the magic provided by IO::Handle.

        4. July 25, 2011

            0. added base of channel modes and mode handler.
               removed useless mode test code (which was replace by mode blocks in user/modes.pm)

            1. made several improvements to the channel mode handler and channel/modes.pm.
               fixed a bug in the user mode handler where force didn't apply blocks.

            2. added ADDCMODE and CMODE server commands.
               burst ADDCMODE and CMODE.

            3. added handlers for ADDCMODE and CMODE.

            4. MODE handler now handles channel mode strings.
               when modes are set to channels, they should properly be sent in MODE messages to both local and non-local members.
               cleaned up a bit in server/handlers.

            5. MODE now accepts a channel with no other parameters.

            6. this should fix a few things.

            7. fixed bug. now the channel modes should be sent among servers.

            8. CHANMODES is now accurate!


            July 26, 2011

            9. fixed a few more things with channel modes and stuff.

        5. July 26, 2011

            0. FINALLY fixed the ridiculous bug that made the IRCd unpractical for use.
               Now we know that this IRCd still has hope to become usable.

            1. fixed a couple of crash bugs in channel communication.

            2. send CMODE types from server-to-server.

            3. added CMODE converter to translate names to modes.

            4. fixed bug in the new mode converter.

            5. made several major improvements to status modes!

            6. added support for five prefixes.

        6. July 27, 2011

            0. This is too big of an update to explain in a few lines.

            July 30, 2011

            1. fixed a number of bugs in the burst with modes, etc.

            2. added mode_string_all, which is the same as mode_string except it sends ALL modes, including status modes and list modes.
               hopefully this will make channels stay in sync with modes (except during netsplits where the lower TS should be taken, but I'll get to that soon.)

            3. more improvements in taking the lower TS.

            4. remove users from status lists when they quit/part/etc.

            5. delete channel data if the last user leaves the channel.

            6. added PART user command.
               added PART server command.
               channel user lists should be 100% accurate at all times now.

            7. hopefully this will fix a few bugs in channel mode syncing.

            8. after all that debugging.. it turned out to be the smallest typo ever.

            9. don't accept mode changes for older times.

        7. July 28, 2011

            0. this bug makes me so extremely angry.

            1. don't allow to /connect to a server that is already connected.
               close connection to a server if it isn't who we thought it was.

            2. hopefully this fixes things.

            3. only ops can set channel modes now.
               also, I'm pretty sure that all of the bugs causing crashes because of unrecognized clients are fixed.

            4. fixed a small bug in the mode handler that leaves an extra + or - on the end of mode strings.
               please don't laugh at how i fixed it.

            5. seeing as the IRCd is beginning to fill out, I added a start/stop/rehash/etc script.
               I might even start changing the version numbers! (the protocol version has been .1 this whole time LoL)

            somewhere in here I skipped like 5 days so I actually did the below in August

            6. added ./juno lines to count the number of lines in your copy.
               added ./juno mkpasswd to run the password generator.

            7. I thought about this, and I think that while might be better than for here.

            8. fixed a couple of things with user modes.

        8. August 4, 2011

            0. channel mode no_ext (no external messages) actually works now.

            1. channel moderation actually works now.

            2. fixed channel mode alphabetization.

            3. added WHO command.

            4. rewriting the main loop in order to hopefully fix some bugs and also support fakelag.
               the same flood protection and stuff has been in juno since pIRCd and definitely needs updated for efficiency and misc. bug fixes.

            5. a few small improvements to handle a heavier load.

            6. more improvements to the main loop.

        9. August 7, 2011

            0. This is probably the biggest commit in the history of juno.
               There are a ton of small changes, but a few in particular that I'd like to point out.
               I found and fixed 3 memory leaks involving references referring to themselves.
               Reference trackers now log to make sure we have no more problems with this.
               IO::Socket::IP is now a dependency but is included with juno.
               The GV system that juno uses has been fixed up.
               Buffered data is now stored within socket objects so modules will be able to read them.
               Data is now parsed immediately after it is received in full, so in cases like a large server burst the rest of the network doesn't just hang until it's over.
               juno is smart enough now to only parse data when it is fully received - sysread sometimes hands it more than it can take in one go.
               This is a huge update. There will probably be some more like this because I'm trying to make juno as efficient and memory-friendly as possible.

            1. Fixed bug where UID was sent to servers before automatic modes were set.
               Fixed RPL_MYINFO to have accurate channel modes.

            2. Fixed the nick collision bug I think.
               ircd no longer crashes if it tries to hash using an unloaded crypt.

            Apparently 3 and 4 were skipped...

            August 24, 2011

            5. Added the dependencies to IO::Socket::IP to dep/.
               Improved security and stability in several places - especially in the linking protocol where incorrect data would cause the IRCd to crash before.
               I really need to stop doing enormous amounts of work without committing, because I end up with huge commits like this one.
               Once again, this is a huge update spanning for / I don't really know what all I changed.

        0. September 17, 2011

            0. This is another large edit. juno3 has new dependencies, but only temporarily.
               These dependencies are required in order to support servers with heavy traffic.
               See README for more information.

            October 10, 2011

            1. added compact JELP commands: AUM, ACM, CUM outgoing and incoming handler.
               re-added ping system after switching to IO::Async.

            October 14, 2011

            2. Perfected new compact JELP commands in the last few commits.

            3. Fixed a bug in the limit checker.
               Added TOPIC user command and made channel mode t functional.

            October 19, 2011

            4. Added server TOPIC command, sort of.

            5. fixed a bug in the new TOPIC handler.

            November 11, 2011

            6. Added connection limit.
               Added client limit.

            November 12, 2011

            7. added max per IP address.

            8. added global max users per IP address.

            9. added see_invisible flag to make invisible users visible in NAMES and WHO.
               made RPL_YOUREOPER a bit more verbose.

        1. November 17, 2011

            0. fixed UID, SID, and server name collision bugs.

            1. fixed a bug where it's possible for a server to receive useless info before burst is sent.

            November 19, 2011

            2. made COMMANDS prettier.

            3. channel mode ban somewhat does what it should now.

            4. added IRCD user command to view general ircd information.

            January 1, 2012

            5. added connection tracking and LUSERS command.

            January 6, 2012

            6. added outgoing TOPICBURST server command.

        2. January 7, 2012

            This is the start of the extension API and modularization of core features.

            1. added API.pm, which manages module loading and unloading.
               added API::Module, the class which all modules will use to add features.
               began API::Base::UserCommands. API::Base::* modules are base classes of API::Module.
               began the first module, core/ping.

            2. finished core/ping.
               updated example configuration.

            3. modularized fake user command.

            4. renamed the new modules to start with 'cmd_', since eventually there will be modules for more than just commands.
               modularized MOTD command.

            5. modularized NICK command.

            6. moved PONG and USER to core/cmd_fakecommands.

            7. modularized INFO command.

            8. undid everything I just did. I have a better idea.

            9. goodbye user/handlers. hello mod/core.

        3. January 13, 2012

            0. Check if 'initialize' is CODE in module instance creation.

            1. unload users commands registered by module at module unload.

            2. added MODLOAD command to core. requires 'modload' flag.
               added more checking to ensure modules that are loaded aren't loaded again.

            3. added MODUNLOAD command to core. requires 'modunload' flag.

            4. added MODRELOAD command to core. requires both 'modunload' and 'modload' flags.
               actually made MODUNLOAD work. I should have tested it earlier.
               it is now possible to reload core, so updating juno's internal commands won't require restarting.

            5. added a command verification system to core.

            January 14, 2012

            6. added UserModes API::Module base for registering user mode blocks. (user_modes)
               user mode letters are now defined in the configuration. see example.
               moved internal user modes to core module.

            7. unload registered user mode blocks when unloading a module.

            8. moved channel modes to the configuration.

            9. fixed a couple bugs in RPL_WELCOME and RPL_MYINFO caused by channel mode modularization.

        4. January 15, 2012

            0. added ChannelModes API::Module base for registering channel mode blocks. (channel_modes)
               moved internal channel mode blocks to the core module.

            1. added TOPICBURST server command handler.

            2. tell channel users when topic is changed by TOPICBURST.

            3. I think I fixed a bug in TOPIC.

            4. I'm tired of nick collision bugs, so here's my temporary solution.

            5. added ServerCommands API::Module base. (server_commands)
               moved server commands to core.

            January 16, 2012
            Goal of the day: moving outgoing server crap to core module.

            6. separated core into several separate modules.

            7. added OutgoingCommands API::Module base for outgoing server commands. (outgoing_commands)

            8. finished core_ocommands :).
               now I have to replace all of the old server::outgoing::* calls with the new system.

            9. finished moving from the old server::outgoing::* system to the new server::mine::fire_command system.
               I have a great feeling that commit this will cause a bug or two.
               In other news, outgoing commands are now modularized.

        5. January 16, 2012

            0. fixed a bug where juno crashes if data is received from a socket that has been ->done. 

            1. fixed a bug where NICK messages were not propagated properly.

            January 17, 2012

            2. fixed a bug in PART messages being propagated.
               moved tons of code from run/ircd to a module, inc/ircd.pm instead.
               this will be useful in future changes.

            3. started working to make most of the ircd reloadable without restarting.

            January 18, 2012

            4. fixed a bug where the same oper flags would be set over and over.

            5. finally fixed all of the nick collision bugs for good.

            January 19, 2012

            6. fixed a bug where AUM was entirely retarded. it was caused by a recent code cleanup.

            7. fixed a bug where users could continuously change their nickname to their UID.

            8. fixed a bug where users returning from away caused adjacent servers to crash.

            January 31, 2012

            9. added the ability to store data with list items in channel mode lists.
               now, each channel mode block cannot assume that a user has operator status as they could before.
               a new status mode/prefix system is on its way, so channel->has_basic_status won't be around much longer.
               added ban list viewing, which should fix the issue with irssi channel synchronization.
               temporarily, anyone can set channel modes until the new channel status system is done.

        6. February 1, 2012

            0. fixed channel->list_has. this fixes a ban matching bug caused by yesterday's changes.

            1. added overload for users. in string context, user objects return UIDs.
               the main advantage of this is readability in logging.

            February 3, 2012

            2. temporarily added a fix for iterating through list values vs. data stored with them, just until I make a less ugly solution.

            3. it is quite embarrassing that this bug has existed throughout nearly two years of development.
               masks should match exactly as expected now.

            February 8, 2012

            4. added REHASH command to core_ucommands. it currently supports local rehashing only.
               this also adds the 'rehash' user flag.
               Fixed a bug win server::linkage where autoconnect didn't work right due to module load timing.

            5. this should fix a small bug where lazy mode handling created a pointless (but not harmful) CMODE message.

            6. If a user is connected through a server whose parent split during a netsplit, the server that split to
               cause this is mentioned in the user's quit message instead of the server the user is physically connected to.

            February 9, 2012

            7. added KILL command (local only, at the moment). it's probably slightly wrong, but after two hours of trying to figure it out, I don't really care.
               this adds the 'kill' user flag.

            February 11, 2012

            8. added KILL server command, outgoing command, and extended user command to support global killing.
               this adds the 'gkill' user flag.

            9. The ServerCommand base's 'params' now has parameter type checking.
               This commit is likely to break the entire IRCd.
               there are two possible outcomes of this update: many, many bugs in the linking protocol will be fixed
               or (and more likely) nothing will work at all, and trying to link two servers will lead to a crash.
               this update breaks compatibility with ALL existing API modules, as register_server_command()'s 'params' option is now required.

        7. February 11, 2012

            0. I was right about breaking the entire ircd. here's the first of many upcoming bug fixes.

            1. more bug fixes regarding the last couple commits.

            February 12, 2012

            2. For some reason, clients don't like when the H or G flag comes before prefix flags.

    0. February 12, 2012

        0. February 12, 2012

            0. first commit.

            1. updated version info. updated README.

            2. removed hideous HUP handler.

            3. removed server 'params' option for register_handler() because it has been replaced by the new parameter checking.
               removed server 'forward' option for seemingly obvious reasons.

            4. in server burst, don't send nonlocal users.
               don't send server information for any server except itself.

            5. actually, it makes more sense to do it this way.

            6. remove 'forward' options from core_scommands.
               in CUM command, don't send nonlocal users.

            7. don't pointlessly remember nonlocal users' prefixes in CUM.
               fixed a bug in server command handler.
               removed pointless code which was used for PRIVMSG and NOTICE forwarding.

            8. added ERROR handler.

            9. fixed bug in PRIVMSG and NOTICE handler which caused massive flooding.
               fixed bug where QUIT message would be sent for server quits.

        1. February 12, 2012

            0. made a much prettier MAP command.

            February 13, 2012

            1. don't pointlessly send KILL messages to all children. send them to the location of the target.

            2. added CONNECT server command for connecting servers remotely.

            3. user->server_notice works on nonlocal users now.
               NOTICE server command supports server noticing now.

            February 14, 2012

            4. new prefix system! now juno can have over 9000 prefixes just like inspircd.
               this adds a major change in the configuration.
               creating a new channel gives the user now status anymore (temporary).
               hopefully I can figure out how to fix that.

            February 15, 2012

            5. added "normal" mode blocks for "normal" channel modes.
               in other words, you have to have some sort of status (halfop+) to set any normal modes unless specified otherwise.

            6. automatic channel modes on join work again. this is a much cleaner approach of doing this.
               this is also used to apply modes to the user who created the channel. see example configuration for details.

            7. send CMODE if modes were changed automatically when channel is created. hopefully this should fix the desync issue.

            February 17, 2012

            8. made COMMANDS command prettier.
               added the fabulous and famous LOLCAT module from juno2.

            February 18, 2012

            9. added MODULES command for viewing loaded IRCd modules.

        2. February 18, 2012

            0. fixed two very-high-priority bugs where '0' can't be a PART message.

            1. MODULES now shows the description of each module.
